# Gorgosaurus

Travis: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arthrp/Gorgosaurus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arthrp/Gorgosaurus)

Gorgosaurus is Nancy-based forum engine. 

### Why?

The goal is to have a minimalistic forum with clean code which can be deployed with smallest possible effort.

### Developer guide

You'll need:
* .NET 4.5 or Mono 3.12 (other Mono versions may work as well)
* `npm` and `bower` (only if you're working front-end, all scripts are checked in)
